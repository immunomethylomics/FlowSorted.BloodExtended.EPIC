DAMAGES OR LOSSES), UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, UNLESS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE LICENSE, EXERCISE OF ANY PERMISSIONS GRANTED UNDER THE LICENSE, OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LIABILITY.

Upon termination of the License, Licensee shall immediately cease exercising all permissions granted under the License, including as applied to any Derivative Work, Licensee must deliver to Licensor any Derivative Works not yet delivered as of the termination date, and Licensee must permanently delete all copies of the Work and Derivative Works within its possession or control.

The License is personal to Licensee and no rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred by Licensee without the prior written consent of Licensor. The License may be modified only in writing signed by the parties hereto. Licensor's failure to assert its rights for or upon any breach of the License will not be deemed a waiver of such rights. Any waiver of rights under the License will be in writing signed by the party granting the waiver. Any waiver of any rights in a specific instance will not be construed as a waiver of any rights in any other instance, whether or not similar. If any provision of the License is held invalid or unenforceable the same will be severed from this document, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of the License. The License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the parties relating to that subject matter. The Exclusive Licensee is a third party beneficiary of this License with the right, but not the obligation, to enforce this License against Licensee. Licensee agrees that any actual or threatened violation of this License may cause irreparable injury to Licensor and the Exclusive Licensee, entitling each to seek injunctive
 
relief in addition to all legal remedies. All notices required or permitted under this License will be effective if made in writing and sent by certified or registered mail, or insured courier, return receipt requested, to the appropriate party at the address set forth above, in the case of Licensor, or in the signature block below, in the case of Licensee, and with the appropriate postage affixed. Notices are deemed given two
(2) business days following the date of mailing and one (1) business day following delivery to a courier. This document may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, that together constitute but one agreement.
11.	Governing Law.

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the laws of the New Hampshire (without regard to the conflicts or choice of law principles thereof). Licensee and Dartmouth irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the State of New Hampshire, and agree that any court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Grafton County, New Hampshire, shall be an appropriate and convenient place of venue to resolve any dispute with respect to this Agreement. In the event either Party commences any proceeding against the other Party with respect to this Agreement, the prevailing Party (as determined by the authority before whom such proceeding is commenced) shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as may be incurred in connection therewith in addition to any such other relief as may be granted.
WHEREAS, this License has been executed by an authorized representative of each party.
